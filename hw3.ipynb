    "Based off of the histograms we can tell that age and education are the main predictors on weather or not a person makes over 50k. Higher age and higher education leads to higher salary based off of our graphs. Capital gains and loss can also be helpful predictors as non zero capital gain/loss tends to lead towards higher income. Hours worked per week is mostly at 40 for most people. With a decent number of people making less than 50k working below and above 40 hours. However it seems that most people making 50k or more are working ATLEAST 40 hours a week. "

But however one can argue that because of past history and also past discriminations by employers and other people, race can have some correlation to income. But for this model its probobly just best to drop that column.|\n",
    "| sex | one-hot encoding with \"binary=True\" |One-hot encoding is necessary because for the purpose of our model we will only have male or female, so doing it in binary makes the most sense. And setting binary=True allows us to only have one column saying either its male or not. We don't need to have a seperate column for female because it will create multicollinearity|\n",
    "| capital.gain | scaling with `StandardScaler` |With captial gail theres large disparity between the values. A lot of people will say 0 while the other chunck will give very large values. Because of this we have a big balance in values.So using a standad scaler with  center the data so that we our outlier dont overwhelm the data.| \n",
    "| capital.loss | scaling with `StandardScaler` |Mostly the same as with capital.gain, lots of zeros but few points outside have very large values. So using standard scaler here will also help us scale our data so the outliers don't overpower the predictor.   |\n",
    "| hours.per.week | scaling with `StandardScaler` |Hours per weak ranges from 1 to 90 which is a very large distribution, and many of the points are around 40 hours. So using standard scaler will allow center the data and improve its varience allowing a more fair comparison across the features.  |\n",
    "| native.country | imputation, one-hot encoding |Similar to the other features native.country has missing values so doing imputation on it will allows us to fill in those missing values. And then using one-hot encoder because one country doesn't hold a higher numerical value over the other one.  | \n",

Create a `sklearn` `ColumnTransformer` named `preprocessor` using [`make_column_transformer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.make_column_transformer.html) with the transformers defined in the previous exercises. Use the sequence below in the column transformer and add a \"drop\" step for the `drop_features` in the end.  \n",

    "2. Transform the data by calling `fit_transform` on the training set and save it as a dataframe in a variable called `transformed_df`. How many new columns have been created in the preprocessed data in comparison to the original `X_train`? Store the difference between the number of columns in `transformed_df` and `X_train` in a variable called `n_new_cols`. \n",

    "1. It is important not to call fit_transform on test data because that will give the model important information on the test set. It will give it info like test mean and std. So because of that we only fit on the training data, and then transform on the test data so that our results aren't skewed in any way.\n",
    "2. It is important to follow the golden rule because we never want to use our test data in any way when training the model. This data is meant to be untouched and to be \"new\" data to model when we test it. So the model can train itself on it. It will give us a worse classifier because the model will already be trained on some test data and so we will get a very high score for our model which is inaccurate and will decieve us and possibly cause further problems with deployed data.\n",
    "3. Pipelines allow us to keep together preprocessing steps and modeling steps so everything runs cleanly and in order. So code is more easier to read when its all in one place in a pipeline. Another benefit of using pipelines is that they make optimizing hyper parameter tuning a lot easier. You can tune parameters all in one fold which will also help with decreasing mistakes.\n",
    "4. Its appropriate to use column transformers when you need to apply preprocessing to different type of features and do different things to them. Like if you need to scale some features, and then apply one-hot encoding on other features. The column transformer allows us to do all of that together to make it easier. This helps us create clean pipelines. "

Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.)
