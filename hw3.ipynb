    "Based off of the histograms we can tell that age and education are the main predictors on weather or not a person makes over 50k. Higher age and higher education leads to higher salary based off of our graphs. Capital gains and loss can also be helpful predictors as non zero capital gain/loss tends to lead towards higher income. Hours worked per week is mostly at 40 for most people. With a decent number of people making less than 50k working below and above 40 hours. However it seems that most people making 50k or more are working ATLEAST 40 hours a week. "

    "Typically, data isn't readily formatted for direct input into machine learning models. It's crucial for a machine learning practitioner to examine each column and determine an effective method for encoding its information. Let's determine the types of features we have and come up with suitable encoding strategies for them. "

    "| Feature | Transformation | Explanation\n",
    "| --- | ----------- | ----- |\n",
    "| age | scaling with `StandardScaler` |  A numeric feature with no missing values, ranging from 17 to 90. Scaling is recommended due to its distinct range compared to other numeric features. While MinMaxScaler might be more suitable, using StandardScaler should be fine too.| \n",
    "| workclass | imputation, one-hot encoding |Because it is a categorical feature we need to use one-hot encoding to convert these features into numerical values. And we specifically use one hot encoding because the categories dont have any numerical value so we choose to do it in binary. And then we also use imputation becauase we have missing values and that will fill them in for us | \n",
    "| fnlwgt | drop | Theres really no distribution for fnlwgt based on our graphs, it add no value to our predictive model so we can drop that column. |\n",
    "| education | ordinal encoding |We have ranking to education like masters student > high school grad. Ordinal encoding allows us to assign integer values while also keeping that order intact.|\n",
    "| education.num | drop | Educational num basically tells us the same thing that the educational column does, so we will have multicollinearity|\n",
    "| marital.status | one-hot encoding  |Allows us to convert categories to numerical values, but a widowed vs married person doesn't hold any rank or higher standard so we only do one-hot encoding |\n",
    "| occupation | imputation, one-hot encoding  |Imputation because have missing values in our data, and the  one-hot encoding because occupation is a very high predictor of income|\n",
    "| relationship | one-hot encoding  |Only one hot encoding becuase we don't really have any true order where ordinal or any other coding would mess up the meaning. So one-hot encoding is suitible for our model. |\n",
    "| race | drop  |It's probobly not the best idea to include race, it can lead to discrimination and overall just insensitive probobly for this class. But however one can argue that because of past history and also past discriminations by employers and other people, race can have some correlation to income. But for this model its probobly just best to drop that column.|\n",
    "| sex | one-hot encoding with \"binary=True\" |One-hot encoding is necessary because for the purpose of our model we will only have male or female, so doing it in binary makes the most sense. And setting binary=True allows us to only have one column saying either its male or not. We don't need to have a seperate column for female because it will create multicollinearity|\n",
    "| capital.gain | scaling with `StandardScaler` |With captial gail theres large disparity between the values. A lot of people will say 0 while the other chunck will give very large values. Because of this we have a big balance in values.So using a standad scaler with  center the data so that we our outlier dont overwhelm the data.| \n",
    "| capital.loss | scaling with `StandardScaler` |Mostly the same as with capital.gain, lots of zeros but few points outside have very large values. So using standard scaler here will also help us scale our data so the outliers don't overpower the predictor.   |\n",
    "| hours.per.week | scaling with `StandardScaler` |Hours per weak ranges from 1 to 90 which is a very large distribution, and many of the points are around 40 hours. So using standard scaler will allow center the data and improve its varience allowing a more fair comparison across the features.  |\n",
    "| native.country | imputation, one-hot encoding |Similar to the other features native.country has missing values so doing imputation on it will allows us to fill in those missing values. And then using one-hot encoder because one country doesn't hold a higher numerical value over the other one.  | \n",

How many new columns have been created in the preprocessed data in comparison to the original `X_train`?

    "1. It is important not to call fit_transform on test data because that will give the model important information on the test set. It will give it info like test mean and std. So because of that we only fit on the training data, and then transform on the test data so that our results aren't skewed in any way.\n",
    "2. It is important to follow the golden rule because we never want to use our test data in any way when training the model. This data is meant to be untouched and to be \"new\" data to model when we test it. So the model can train itself on it. It will give us a worse classifier because the model will already be trained on some test data and so we will get a very high score for our model which is inaccurate and will decieve us and possibly cause further problems with deployed data.\n",
    "3. Pipelines allow us to keep together preprocessing steps and modeling steps so everything runs cleanly and in order. So code is more easier to read when its all in one place in a pipeline. Another benefit of using pipelines is that they make optimizing hyper parameter tuning a lot easier. You can tune parameters all in one fold which will also help with decreasing mistakes.\n",
    "4. Its appropriate to use column transformers when you need to apply preprocessing to different type of features and do different things to them. Like if you need to scale some features, and then apply one-hot encoding on other features. The column transformer allows us to do all of that together to make it easier. This helps us create clean pipelines. "

    "In this exercise, you'll carry out hyperparameter optimization for the hyperparameter `C` of SVC RBF classifier. In practice, you'll carry out hyperparameter optimization for all different hyperparameters of the most promising classifiers. For the purpose of this assignment, we'll only do it for the `SVC` classifier with one hyperparameter, namely `C`. \n",

    "    - Carry out 5-fold cross validation with the pipeline.  \n",
    "    - Store the results in `results_dict` and display results as a pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "2. Which hyperparameter value seems to be performing the best? In this assignment, consider the hyperparameter value that gives you the highest cross-validation score as the \"best\" one. Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.) Is it different than the default value for the hyperparameter used by `scikit-learn`? \n",
